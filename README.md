👋 Hello, I’m Iheduru – Frontend Developer & Web Engineer

I'm a detail-oriented and passionate frontend developer focused on building sleek, responsive, and user-centric web applications. I thrive on transforming UI/UX designs into fully functional interfaces and love solving real-world problems with clean, scalable code.

💼 What I Do

🎨 Frontend Development  
I specialize in creating responsive and accessible user interfaces using modern JavaScript frameworks like **React** and **Vue.js**. From dashboards to e-commerce to real estate platforms, I bring ideas to life with pixel-perfect precision.

📱 Progressive Web Apps (PWA)  
I build fast, offline-first experiences with **service workers**, **local storage**, and PWA best practices — bridging the gap between web and mobile.

🌐 API Integration & State Management  
Proficient in **React Query**, **Axios**, and **Context API**, I create seamless data-driven experiences that connect to robust backends using **JWT** and RESTful APIs.

📦 Component-Based Architecture  
I leverage **Tailwind CSS**, **Formik + Yup**, and **Headless UI** to build reusable, themeable component systems that scale.

💡 Real-World Platforms  
I develop and contribute to platforms like e-commerce, e-learning, facial recognition portals, and real estate dashboards.
